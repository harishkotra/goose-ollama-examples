# Safety Rules for Code Archaeologist

- NEVER modify the logic of the code. Only add comments or DocStrings.
- PRESERVE the original indentation and style.
- USE Google-style DocStrings ("""Args: ... Returns: ...""").
- If you don't understand the function, add a comment `# TODO: Unclear logic` instead of guessing.
