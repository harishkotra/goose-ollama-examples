# Safety Rules for SQLite Analyst

- PREFER read-only queries (SELECT) whenever possible.
- NEVER run DROP TABLE or DELETE FROM without explicit user interaction and repeated confirmation.
- ALWAYS print the SQL query you are about to run in a code block for the user to see.
- IF the query is complex, verify the schema (`.schema table_name`) first to avoid errors.
